These are various tools useful in development of ming.  None are
particularly user friendly.  All take one command line argument, a file
name.  listswf and listfdb aren't very smart about checking for the end of
the file, so you should pipe it through a pager..

  bindump - show file data in hex and binary
  hexdump - show file data in hex
  listswf - swf format disassembler
  listfdb - show contents of fdb font file
  listmp3 - show frame header info in an mp3 file
  listjpeg - show frame header info in a jpeg file
  makefdb - rip fdb font definition files out of a generator template file
  swftophp - attempt to make a php/ming script out of an swf file

  try "make <name>" where name is the program you want to build

How do you make a generator template file?  Write some text in a flash movie
using MM Flash, under "save as.." select "Generator Template".  Feed that
file into makefdb, and it'll save every font def'n found therein into a file
<font>.fdb.  If you don't save as a template, it won't write the entire glyph
set out, only the letters you've actually used..  See, it's smart that way.
