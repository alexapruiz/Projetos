MING THE MODULE

It's an SWF output library.  And it's a PHP module.  And so much more..

It comprises almost all of Flash 4's functionality; the only thing missing
is sound support (although you can do mp3 streaming now).

Specifically, it lets you create: shapes (including morphs), text, sprites
(aka movie clips), buttons, and actions in flash movies.

The goal for Ming is to abstract away all of the mundane specifics of the
SWF file format.

Ming also includes a PHP wrapper which wraps Ming objects in PHP objects.
Pretty cool..

The python wrapper has been updated to mirror the functionality of the PHP
interface, so you should be able to use the PHP documentation without
getting terribly confused now.

There's a perl XS wrapper now.  But I haven't used it so I can't tell you
much about it.

The c++ wrapper is just one big header file.  But it seems to work pretty
well- check the examples directory.

Ming is released under the LGPL.  See file LICENSE for the gory details.

BUILDING and INSTALLING:

no fancy autoconf nonsense here, just raw old-fashioned Makefiles.

  unpack the tarfile (which you've obviously already done)
  make

  for the PHP module:
  (should work with PHP-4.0.2 and up..)

    to build as a PHP module (.so file):

      make static
      cd php_ext
      make
      make install

    to build into the php source:

      mkdir <phpdir>/ext/ming
      cp php_ext/* <phpdir>/ext/ming
      cd <phpdir>
      ./buildconf
      ./configure --with-ming=<mingdir> <other config options>
      build and install php as usual,
      restart web server if necessary

  for python:
  (I think you need python 1.5.2 or above..)

    make static
    cd py_ext
    make mingcmodule.so
    fix the install path in the Makefile
    make install


USING MING:

  check the examples in the "examples" directory
  Oh wait, it's not there anymore.  Check the web site.
  Make your own, better, examples and send them to me.
