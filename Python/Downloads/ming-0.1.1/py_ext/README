README

PMing - a Python module for the Ming library

WHAT'S NEW

- 19 Nov 2000: Dave adds destructors, messes up the ming.py file so it
		acts like the php interface

- 24 Oct 2000: Dave makes an attempt at updating python wrapper for 0.0.3a

- 11 July 2000: First release. Preliminary python class wrapper done. 


FEATURES

Acts just like the PHP interface, so documentation is now usable. :)


REQUIREMENTS
- Python 1.5.2 or above.
- Ming library v.0.0.4
- a recent version of SWIG if you're going to rebuild ming_wrap.c
  SWIG 1.1p5 (which comes with Debian 2.2) won't work.
